# 🎯 Bitmap Pattern Dithering Test Guide

## ✅ **SUCCESS!** Your bitmap pattern loading feature is ready to test!

### 📁 Test Patterns Created:
Located in `resources/patterns/`:
- ✅ `test_pattern.bmp` - Simple checkerboard (16x16)
- ✅ `macpaint_dots.bmp` - Dot pattern in MacPaint style  
- ✅ `macpaint_diagonal.bmp` - Diagonal lines
- ✅ `macpaint_brick.bmp` - Brick texture pattern
- ✅ `macpaint_checker.bmp` - Checkerboard pattern

### 🎮 **Testing Instructions:**

#### **Step 1: Launch IMG2PAL** ✅ 
```
IMG2PAL.exe is running and ready!
```

#### **Step 2: Navigate to Pattern Dithering**
1. Use `<` and `>` keys to cycle through dithering methods
2. Find method **23: "Pattern Dithering"**
3. You should see it display the current pattern type

#### **Step 3: Load a Bitmap Pattern**
1. Press `M` key to open file browser
2. Navigate to `resources\patterns\`
3. Select one of the test patterns (e.g., `test_pattern.bmp`)
4. The pattern should load successfully

#### **Step 4: Test Pattern Switching**
1. Press `K` key to cycle through pattern types
2. You should see:
   - **0**: Crosshatch (built-in)
   - **1**: Dots (built-in)  
   - **2**: Lines (built-in)
   - **3**: Mesh (built-in)
   - **4**: Custom (built-in)
   - **5**: "From File" (your loaded bitmap!)

#### **Step 5: Test Pattern Intensity**
1. Use `+` and `-` keys to adjust pattern strength
2. Range: 0% to 200%
3. Watch how the pattern effect changes

#### **Step 6: Load Different Patterns**
1. Press `M` again to load different patterns
2. Try each of the MacPaint-style patterns
3. Notice how each creates a unique dithering effect

### 🔍 **What to Look For:**

#### **✅ Success Indicators:**
- **File browser opens** when pressing `M`
- **Pattern loads without errors** after selection
- **Status shows filename** (e.g., "Pattern Dithering (test_pattern.bmp)")
- **Pattern switching works** with `K` key
- **Dithering effect changes** based on loaded pattern
- **Intensity adjustment works** with `+`/`-` keys

#### **🚨 Potential Issues to Check:**
- File browser doesn't open → Check file dialog implementation
- Pattern doesn't load → Check file format support
- Pattern looks wrong → Check 1-bit conversion logic
- Switching doesn't work → Check pattern array indexing

### 🎨 **Pattern Effects to Expect:**

#### **test_pattern.bmp (Checkerboard):**
- Should create a regular checkerboard dithering effect
- Clear alternating pattern in dithered areas

#### **macpaint_dots.bmp:**
- Dotted/stippled appearance
- Regular dot spacing in dithered regions

#### **macpaint_diagonal.bmp:**
- Diagonal line texture
- Slanted hatching effect

#### **macpaint_brick.bmp:**
- Brick-like texture pattern
- Offset horizontal lines

#### **macpaint_checker.bmp:**
- Similar to test pattern but different scale
- Square checkerboard texture

### 🚀 **Advanced Testing:**

1. **Try loading other image files** (PNG, GIF, TGA)
2. **Test with different color palettes** 
3. **Combine with various intensity settings**
4. **Test with different input images**
5. **Create your own custom patterns**

### 📊 **Performance Check:**
- Pattern loading should be **instant**
- Pattern switching should be **real-time**
- No memory leaks or crashes
- Smooth interaction with all other features

### 🎯 **This Feature Completes Your Dithering Arsenal:**

You now have **24 total dithering methods**:
- **11 Error Diffusion algorithms** (Floyd-Steinberg family)
- **4 Ordered Dithering matrices** (Bayer patterns)
- **3 Noise-based methods** (Random, Blue Noise, IGN)
- **5 Built-in patterns** (Crosshatch, Dots, Lines, Mesh, Custom)
- **1 Bitmap pattern loader** (MacPaint compatibility!)

### 🏆 **Achievement Unlocked:**
**"Master of Dithering" - From classic algorithms to custom bitmap patterns, you've got every dithering technique covered!**
