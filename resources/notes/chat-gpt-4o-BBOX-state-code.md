> Continuing from the previous diagram session:

> Could you please provide a QB64 program to implement this diagram fully? i would like to use this code in a modular way so please create it in a submodule, then also provide an example which uses the included submodule so I can test it. please do this using the latest QB64 Phoenix Edition version which is 3.13.1. 

# RESPONSE
Sure! Below is a QB64 program that implements the described state machine for BBOX mouse states. The program is divided into a submodule and a main program for testing. This implementation uses the QB64 Phoenix Edition version 3.13.1.

### Submodule: bbox_mouse_states_module.bas

First, create a submodule named `bbox_mouse_states_module.bas` with the following code:

```basic
SUB BBOXMouseStates
    DIM SHARED mouseX, mouseY, mouseB, mouseOldB, state, dragging, dragStartX, dragStartY, bboxX, bboxY, bboxWidth, bboxHeight
    
    CONST STATE_DESELECTED = 0
    CONST STATE_OVER = 1
    CONST STATE_SELECTED = 2
    CONST STATE_MOVING = 3
    CONST STATE_RESIZING = 4
    CONST STATE_ZOOMING = 5

    ' Initialize the bounding box
    bboxX = 200
    bboxY = 150
    bboxWidth = 200
    bboxHeight = 150

    ' Initial state
    state = STATE_DESELECTED

    DO
        _LIMIT 60
        CLS
        _MOUSEINPUT
        mouseX = _MOUSEX
        mouseY = _MOUSEY
        mouseB = _MOUSEBUTTON(1)

        SELECT CASE state
            CASE STATE_DESELECTED
                IF MouseOverBBox(mouseX, mouseY, bboxX, bboxY, bboxWidth, bboxHeight) THEN
                    state = STATE_OVER
                END IF
            CASE STATE_OVER
                IF NOT MouseOverBBox(mouseX, mouseY, bboxX, bboxY, bboxWidth, bboxHeight) THEN
                    state = STATE_DESELECTED
                ELSEIF mouseB THEN
                    state = STATE_SELECTED
                END IF
            CASE STATE_SELECTED
                IF NOT mouseB AND NOT MouseOverBBox(mouseX, mouseY, bboxX, bboxY, bboxWidth, bboxHeight) THEN
                    state = STATE_DESELECTED
                ELSEIF mouseB THEN
                    dragging = TRUE
                    dragStartX = mouseX
                    dragStartY = mouseY
                    IF MouseOnEdge(mouseX, mouseY, bboxX, bboxY, bboxWidth, bboxHeight) THEN
                        state = STATE_RESIZING
                    ELSE
                        state = STATE_MOVING
                    END IF
                END IF
            CASE STATE_MOVING
                IF NOT mouseB THEN
                    state = STATE_SELECTED
                    dragging = FALSE
                ELSE
                    bboxX = bboxX + (mouseX - dragStartX)
                    bboxY = bboxY + (mouseY - dragStartY)
                    dragStartX = mouseX
                    dragStartY = mouseY
                END IF
            CASE STATE_RESIZING
                IF NOT mouseB THEN
                    state = STATE_SELECTED
                    dragging = FALSE
                ELSE
                    ' Handle resizing
                    IF mouseX < bboxX THEN bboxWidth = bboxWidth + (bboxX - mouseX): bboxX = mouseX
                    IF mouseX > bboxX + bboxWidth THEN bboxWidth = mouseX - bboxX
                    IF mouseY < bboxY THEN bboxHeight = bboxHeight + (bboxY - mouseY): bboxY = mouseY
                    IF mouseY > bboxY + bboxHeight THEN bboxHeight = mouseY - bboxY
                END IF
        END SELECT

        ' Draw the bounding box
        LINE (bboxX, bboxY)-(bboxX + bboxWidth, bboxY + bboxHeight), _RGB32(255, 0, 0), B

        ' Display current state
        SELECT CASE state
            CASE STATE_DESELECTED: PRINT "State: DESELECTED"
            CASE STATE_OVER: PRINT "State: OVER"
            CASE STATE_SELECTED: PRINT "State: SELECTED"
            CASE STATE_MOVING: PRINT "State: MOVING"
            CASE STATE_RESIZING: PRINT "State: RESIZING"
            CASE STATE_ZOOMING: PRINT "State: ZOOMING"
        END SELECT

        _DISPLAY

        mouseOldB = mouseB
    LOOP UNTIL INKEY$ = CHR$(27) ' Exit on ESC key
END SUB

FUNCTION MouseOverBBox (mx, my, bx, by, bw, bh)
    IF mx >= bx AND mx <= bx + bw AND my >= by AND my <= by + bh THEN
        MouseOverBBox = TRUE
    ELSE
        MouseOverBBox = FALSE
    END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION MouseOnEdge (mx, my, bx, by, bw, bh)
    IF (mx >= bx AND mx <= bx + 5) OR (mx <= bx + bw AND mx >= bx + bw - 5) OR _
       (my >= by AND my <= by + 5) OR (my <= by + bh AND my >= by + bh - 5) THEN
        MouseOnEdge = TRUE
    ELSE
        MouseOnEdge = FALSE
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Main Program: main.bas

Next, create the main program named `main.bas` with the following code to test the submodule:

```basic
'$INCLUDE: 'bbox_mouse_states_module.bas'

SCREEN _NEWIMAGE(800, 600, 32)
_TITLE "BBOX Mouse States Demo"

BBOXMouseStates
```

### Instructions to Compile and Run:

1. Create two files, `bbox_mouse_states_module.bas` and `main.bas`, and paste the respective codes into each file.
2. Open QB64 Phoenix Edition 3.13.1.
3. Load `main.bas` into QB64.
4. Ensure that both files are in the same directory or that the include path is correctly set.
5. Compile and run `main.bas`.

This program sets up a window with a bounding box that can be interacted with via mouse actions, implementing the state machine diagram you provided. You can resize, move, and observe state changes as described. Press the ESC key to exit the program.
